# Activity Tracker / Fit Lit

Fit Lit is a wellness tracking dashboard that takes in multiple user data files and synthesizes the information to a usable display for a given user for a given day and also provides weekly statistics for the user's hydration, activity and sleep. The page also displays a weekly step challenge among the user and other users.
